While we have made significant legislative progress, the ground reality demands more concrete action.\n\nIn my constituency of Chandigarh, we have implemented several initiatives including 24/7 women helplines, self-defense training programs, and women-only transport services during late hours. These measures have resulted in a 40% increase in women's participation in night-shift employment.\n\nHowever, true empowerment goes beyond safety measures. We need comprehensive policies that ensure equal opportunities in education, employment, and entrepreneurship. I propose the establishment of women entrepreneurship hubs in every district to provide financial support, mentorship, and market access to women-led businesses.`,
